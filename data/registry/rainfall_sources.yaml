    region: Global
    priority: 10
    unit: inch
    biases:
    - Hourly resolution may miss short intense bursts
    - Station density varies by region
    limitations:
    - Data latency of 1-2 days
    - Some stations have gaps

    unit: mm
    biases:
    - Model-derived, not direct observation
    - May underestimate convective peaks
    limitations:

    priority: 25
    unit: mm/hr
    biases:
    - Beam blockage in hilly terrain
    - Z-R relationship uncertainty
    - Ground clutter near radar
    limitations:
    - Radar data requires manual download
    - NetCDF format needs preprocessing
